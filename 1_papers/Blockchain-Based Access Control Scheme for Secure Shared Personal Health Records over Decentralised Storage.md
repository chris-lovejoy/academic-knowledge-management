## Summary and high-level thoughts
- talks about SC-ABSE as a new cryptographic concept that enables access management
- looks like a pretty technical dive into the ways that this can be used.
- **a fantastic article for points about storage of health data on IPFS, encryption, etc. Some really helpful clarifying points made in the Introduction**. 

The article points out that 
- storing in the cloud resolves scalability but reduces security
- IPFS prevents reliance on cloud servers, but has a security flaw: "anyone with the hash of the file can easily retrieve it" [which presumably reduces the security]
- therefore, they argue that **health data on IPFS is only appropriate if encrypted before being outsourced to IPFS**.
- (then dives into details around the cryptographic requirements + what they've proposed. lots of proofs)
- (also outlines some of the potential attacks and how this is defended against)
- one downside of this encryption is that it can make it harder to access the data in the cases of an emergency (presumably as the encryption needs to be un-encrypted, which may take time? or may even not be possible without the right permission/access key from the patient?)

## Highlights

"Given its transparency and decentralised features, medical data are visible to everyone on the network and are inappropriate for certain medical applications. By contrast, storing vast medical data, such as patient medical history, laboratory tests, X-rays, and MRIs, significantly affect the repository storage of blockchain." ([Hussien et al 2021:2462](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4TTL9KSM?page=1))

"This study bridges the gap between PHRs and blockchain technology by offloading the vast medical data into the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) storage and establishing an enforced cryptographic authorisation and access control scheme for outsourced encrypted medical data." ([Hussien et al 2021:2462](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4TTL9KSM?page=1))

"The access control scheme is constructed on the basis of the new lightweight cryptographic concept named smart contract-based attribute-based searchable encryption (SC-ABSE). This newly cryptographic primitive is developed by extending ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) and searchable symmetric encryption (SSE)" ([Hussien et al 2021:2462](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4TTL9KSM?page=1))

"Recent findings tend to resolve the above issues by storing medical databases on offline storage, such as cloud servers, and by setting up an access control scheme to prevent unauthorised users from manipulating data through leveraging the attribute-based cryptosystem [11-13] reproxy encryption [14,15] and smart contracts [16-18] to control the users' privilege" ([Hussien et al 2021:2463](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4TTL9KSM?page=2))

"At the same time, other researchers have attempted to offload the actual large-scale distributed data into the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) storage without setting up any enforced cryptographic access control [19,20]." ([Hussien et al 2021:2463](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4TTL9KSM?page=2))

"Meanwhile, concepts of outsourced blockchain databases on honest-but-curious thirdparty storage, such as cloud servers, are considered a double-edged sword technique that resolves the scalability issue. However, it decreases the security level of blockchain against fully decentralised infrastructure and increases the level of single security failure." ([Hussien et al 2021:2463](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4TTL9KSM?page=2))

"Simultaneously, the outsourcing of databases on IPFS decentralised storage eliminates the unreliable storage of third parties. Nevertheless, IPFS has a noticeable security flow that anyone with the hash of the file stored therein can easily retrieve it due to IPFS native workflow." ([Hussien et al 2021:2463](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4TTL9KSM?page=2))

"In conclusion, the health data generated by patients are not well suitable for being stored in IPFS unless data are encrypted individually prior to outsourcing to the IPFS. Therefore, providing security and privacy to PHR systems with fine-grained access control is essential to support a technique that searches for encrypted data on the IPFS storage." ([Hussien et al 2021:2463](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4TTL9KSM?page=2))

"To overcome this problem, some researchers are attempting to combine searchable symmetric encryption and ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption." ([Hussien et al 2021:2464](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4TTL9KSM?page=3))

"However, this hybrid encryption scheme requires centralised key management in a cloud server, leading to a single point of security failure because the cloud platform may not be credible due to employee corruption or a threat to the authorisation centre." ([Hussien et al 2021:2464](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4TTL9KSM?page=3))

"Fortunately, the use of blockchain technology and smart contracts can easily and securely manage key management and distribution." ([Hussien et al 2021:2464](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4TTL9KSM?page=3))

"To overcome the aforementioned challenge, this study proposes a new lightweight cryptographic concept called smart contract-based attribute-based searchable encryption (SC-ABSE) by combining ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE), searchable symmetric encryption (SSE), smart contract, and IPFS storage." ([Hussien et al 2021:2464](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4TTL9KSM?page=3))

"7. Conclusions and Open Directions" ([Hussien et al 2021:2489](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4TTL9KSM?page=28))

"The present study makes several noteworthy contributions to remedy blockchain technology's limitations in terms of privacy and scalability storage over healthcare applications." ([Hussien et al 2021:2489](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4TTL9KSM?page=28))

"The proposed scheme achieves a high level of security with less computation, storage and communication costs compared with other existing state-of-the-art schemes." ([Hussien et al 2021:2489](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4TTL9KSM?page=28))

"The generalisability of these results is subject to certain limitations. Firstly, the traditional access control enables authorised users to decrypt the medical data of patients stored in IPFS. However, it hinders first-aid treatment when the patient's life is threatened because on-site first-aid medical personnel cannot obtain the patient's historical medical data. To address this challenge, break-glass access control protocol underneath emergency scenarios is needed in SC-ABSE to allow medical personnel to retrieve the patient's historical medical data stored in IPFS securely and quickly. Secondly, user and attribute revocation mechanisms are needed throughout (BC-ABSE) to revoke or upgrade their attributes in the system. Therefore, future research should concentrate on the limitations described above to meet a proper decentralised healthcare application." ([Hussien et al 2021:2490](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4TTL9KSM?page=29))
